# TumourMetrics
TumourMetrics has been designed to meet the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) v.1.0 profile, 
while allowing flexible parametrization of the analysis protocol depending on consensus approvals. 
The quality performance was assessed using the QIBA test data and our customizable numeric phantom.
The analysis is easy-to-use and accessible for routine implementation into clinical practice.
