{"name":"Tumourmetrics","tagline":"Quantitative MRI Tools","body":"A reliable analysis methodology is needed to provide valuable biomarkers for clinical trials. The “TumourMetrics Suite” is a set of custom-designed post-processing modules for the evaluation of tumour volume, micro-environmental and functional parameters. As a scanner independent module, we provide a comprehensive analysis tools for the quantification and the quality assessment of DCE-MRI data that achieve the required compliance level of multi-centric trials.\r\nThe analysis is easy-to-use and accessible for routine implementation into clinical practice. The method is robust, almost full automatic and error estimate of the parameter is documented. The results can be immediately interpreted using many useful computer-aided functions, and sent to PACS. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
